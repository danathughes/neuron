- Refactor various subsystems to inherit from an abstract class Subsystem with pure virtual StartUp and ShutDown methods.
- Clean up makefile so I don't need to add a new line for every class I create.
- Clean up makefile so dependencies are easily listed for tests
- Conventions are getting out of hand; clean them up and standardize.

- See this guy's engine: https://github.com/danielunderwood/glfw-game-engine
- and the associated build system (how tf do you use these? https://travis-ci.org/danielunderwood/glfw-game-engine)
